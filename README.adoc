the mor programming language, it was created to build a compiler as a hobby and develop my own programming language where I can play with the syntax as much as I want to be able to write consice and okayish performant programs.

== TODOs:

* [ ] Yet another compiler, ast refactor
* [ ] Fix pointer bug
* [ ] Implement else expr
* [ ] Implement loops
* [ ] Come up with easy syntax
* [ ] Maybe delete pointers as a whole because they don't add to the simplistic aspect of the language

== Bugs:

* [ ] wrong pointer dereferencing (*d = &a | a = *d)
* [ ] probably a few more lurking
