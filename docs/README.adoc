== TL;DR

Mor is a programming language which I created just for fun and learning things with the goal of 0 dependencies and being self hosted in the future.

== thinking

* currently deleted everything again so do it properly this time
* make compile_expr, compile_func, etc. return a vec of opcodes so it can be tested and help for better extraction between functions and main block

== far future

these goals could take as long as 10 - 15 years (still very ambitious but would be very interesting)

* [ ] complete mor language
* [ ] write self hosted version
* [ ] write the morsm assembler in mor
* [ ] write the morld linker in mor
* [ ] write the moros operating system in mor
