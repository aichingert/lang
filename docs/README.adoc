the mor programming language, it was created to build a compiler as a hobby and develop my own programming language where I can play with the syntax as much as I want to be able to write consice and okayish performant programs.

== todo:

* [x] Implement else expr
* [x] Implement arrays
* [x] Implement loops
* [ ] Implement functions
* [ ] Implement boolean logic (a = 10 > 4, etc.)
* [ ] Come up with easy syntax

== bug:

* [ ] if has a few bugs with && and || precedence
* [ ] when there is an if or another loop inside a loop then the labels will get messed up resulting in infinite loops
* [ ] probably a few more lurking

== far future

these goals could take as long as 10 - 15 years (still very ambitious but would be very interesting)

* [ ] complete mor language
* [ ] write self hosted version
* [ ] write the morsm assembler in mor
* [ ] write the morld linker in mor
* [ ] write the moros operating system in mor
